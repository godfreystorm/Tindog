# Tindog
A dating site for dogs.
This project is a static webpage designed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and other related technologies. It is a mock-up of a dating app for dogs and provides a fun, lightweight look at what an app interface could look like.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for the basic structure of the website.
CSS3: Used for additional styling outside of what Bootstrap provides.
Bootstrap 5.3.0: This is the primary framework used in the project for styling and layout. Bootstrap's grid system was used extensively for responsive design.
CSS Flexbox: Used in certain sections to handle layout and responsiveness where Bootstrap's functionality wasn't required.
SVG Icons: SVG icons from the Bootstrap Icons library are used in several places for visually engaging user interface components.
